--	doscript fix for mod support.
--		
--		Lovingly made by BulletMagnet, in the space of an hour, one Summer afternoon. 
--		
--		TL; DR (the code).
--			The script should have some smarts about it, and only hokey about with the 
--				doscript function once - no matter how many times, this code appears 
--				in loaded mods.
--			
--			When doscript is called, it first tries to run in the conventional manner.
--			If that fails, for whatever reason (primarily because files are 404),
--				it searches the folders listed in the __active_mods table for files 
--				with matching a directory+name. 
--			Each potential file is checked, and the first to successfully complete will
--				cause the script to return. 
--			If the script still can't process any files successfully, it will then 
--				error-out and return the error from the initial doscript call. 
--		
--		This script assumes that the first file found is the desired one, and won't bother 
--			trying subsequent mods. If this were to change, or be added, then mod-order 
--			would have to be checked too. 
--		
--		Hooking files that another mod introduces isn't recommended.
--			...It probably doesn't work.
--		
--		Script is such a weird looking word, like sombrero.
